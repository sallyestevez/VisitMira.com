      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
      <h3>What's so special about Mira?</h3>
      <p>Well, there's just something about this planet.</p>
      <p>Mira is 400 square kilometers of exhilaration. You get to explore not
        one, but FIVE different regions. From Oblivia's dry climate, to Cauldros'
        volcanic terrain, there's something for everyone.</p>
      <h3>What does Mira look like?</h3>
      <p>This is a very broad question. It would be better to ask what each region
      looks like instead, since they are all so different. Feel free to learn
      more about the different regions by clicking on each of the links at the
      top of the page.</p>
      <p>We can provide you with this map of the planet.</p>

      <h3>How do you get there?</h3>
      <p>You'll be traveling through space, along with the other lucky passengers.
        However, no none actually knows where Mira is. Trust us when we say that
        you'll get here. Eventually. Also, you can't go back. We're stuck on
        Mira forever.</p>
      <h3>Where will I be staying on Mira?</h3>
      <p>You'll be staying in New Los Angeles, located in Primordia! More info
        under <a href="primordia.html">Primordia's page</a>.</p>
      <h3>How can I get around while on Mira?</h3>
      <p>Either by walking/running everywhere or by Skell.</p>
      <h3>What is a Skell? How can I get it?</h3>
      <p>A Skell is a giant mech. In its bipedal form, you can walk around or fly
        in it. It can also transform into a vehicle. All of these forms make it
        easier for you to travel around Mira. You can only get a Skell if you
        pass the Skell License Certification Test.</p>
